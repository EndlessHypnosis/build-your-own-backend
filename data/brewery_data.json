  "description": "Meet “MacBubba”. This BIG, good ol’ boy is Scottish to the core. He is bold, but absolutely loveable. Once you get to know MacBubba, you won’t know how you went anywhere without him. This Scotch Ale has a subtle smoky undertone not found in many other beers. Starting with a beautiful dark-amber color it has a nice rich aroma that follows with a full bodied caramel flavor. You will note a\r\nslight “peaty” character in the finish, derived from the addition of some of the finest Peated Malt from Scotland. We think you will find this Scotch Ale very easy to enjoy while still bold enough to stand up to a harsh winter chill.",

Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

The MadTree approach is simple – create high quality beer, educate the consumer, run a responsible business, and support the local communities.\r\nMadTree engages local artists and craftspeople for their marketing materials, can designs, tap handles and furniture. Many of these efforts have received local and national recognition.\r\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS\r\n- The trio quit their corporate jobs in 2012/2013 and in January 2013 they brewed their first commercial batch.\r\n- In April they opened their taproom and became the first modern craft brewery to can their beer in the state of Ohio.\r\n- Draft Magazine rated PsycHOPathy IPA a 97/100, the second best score for an IPA reviewed by Draft Magazine.\r\n- PsycHOPathy IPA was named as one of the “Six New Craft Can Designs That Belong in an Art Gallery” by craftcans.com",

After months of maturation in Bourbon barrels, our barleywine mellows thoroughly, with a luxuriously rich mouthfeel and a soft, rounded finish. Caramel malts shine through on this copper hued ale with hints of vanillin imparted by the toasted oak barrels, making Bourbon Barleywine a decadent accompaniment to sweets, or a dessert all by itself.",

Moody Tongue, a nickname for a guest with a discerning palate, features “culinary brewing,” Rouben’s original approach that combines the worlds of brewing and cooking through the application of a chef's mindset to the brewing process. Classically trained at the Culinary Institute of America in New York, Rouben worked in lauded Michelin-starred kitchens such as the Martini House in Napa, CA, and Thomas Keller’s Per Se in New York City before moving to Chicago to pursue a career in brewing. During the fall of 2016, Moody Tongue introduced a tasting room to its brewery in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago, serving year-round and limited-release beers in an intimate mid-century modern atmosphere with Michelin-minded service. The Tasting Room is open Thursday from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.; Friday from 5 p.m. to 12 a.m.; Saturday from 12 p.m. to 12 a.m.; Sunday from 12 p.m. to 9 p.m.; and Monday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. The Tasting Room is closed Tuesday and Wednesday.",

Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity. Working in a small English-style brewery in Western Maryland, Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit decided to take matters into their own hands, and in 1994, they founded Yards Brewing Company.",

      "description": "The 350 Brewing Company has spawned from the ashes of our failed Collegiate careers at Northern Illinois University. Let me explain. 350 Augusta Ave. was our address in Dekalb, IL. At the time, your founders Todd and Erik spent more time on projects like way below average punk rock bands in the attic, and a Hardcore Wrestling Federation called WCVF (this took place in our kitchen), instead of focusing on classes like Humanities 227 in DuSable Hall. I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to \"550 degrees\"? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night. This raw energy (stupidity) and creativity is what eventually drew us to the Craft Beer scene. That’s what craft beer is…a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well…..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.\r\n\r\nOnce NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik’s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!! \r\n\r\nFrom that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park’s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to joining the family of incredible Illinois Brewers. We should all thank our lucky stars that we live in a state with such high quality Breweries.",

This distinctive beer is an homage to the finest of British brews and a favourite of those want mouth-filling flavour when they’re in the pub or at home.\r\n\r\nCanterbury features a smooth, mature taste to complement its bold, rich colour while retaining a lager’s traditional, fresh finish. This classically brewed beer is a tad sweeter than its pale pilsner cousins and a natural complement to a good Irish Stew or other full-bodied fare. The ideal match is most pub grub like fish and chips or steak and kidney pie",

Many of our brews are unique twists on traditional recipes, while others are products of our own imaginations. We’re proud to say that several of our beers have brought home national and international medals and awards, but what we really care about is brewing the kinds of beer we like to drink, and providing a fresh local option to our communities. It never hurts to get a pat on the back, though! Along the way, we’ve made lots of friends and drank our unfair share of good beer, all while trying to do good in our communities and do well as a craft brewery.",

Its name honors the Maillard reaction—the “browning” of sugars and amino acids—that creates the wonderful caramelized toffee-like and roasted flavors so abundant in this beer.\r\n\r\nBell’s has done a lot to raise the Midwest’s craft beer bona fides. They are masters of many beer styles from their portfolio of top-notch American stouts all the way through to the alpha acid assault of their Hopslam Ale. Bell’s constantly reinvents beer styles and refines recipes with artful mastery and an oddball slant.",

    "description": "These beers must portray the unique characters imparted by yeasts typically used in fruity and big Belgian-Style ales - These beers are not traditional Belgian styles which are already defined. They are unique beers unto themselves. Notes of banana, berry, apple, sometimes coriander spice-like and/or smoky-phenolic characters should be portrayed with balance of hops and malt character when fermented with such yeast. Hop aroma, flavor and bitterness not usually found in the base style, can be medium to very high and must show the characters of American hop varieties. Dark color falls in the deep amber/brown to black range. Roasted malts or barley may have a range of character from subtle to robust, and should be reflected in the overall character and balance of the beer. Esters should be at medium to high levels. Diacetyl should not be evident. Chill haze may be evident. Sulfurlike yeast character should be absent. No Brettanomyces character should be present. An ale which exhibits Brettanomyces character would be classified as \"American-style Brett Ale.\"A statement by the brewer that could include information such as style being elaborated upon, and other information about the entry with regard to flavor, aroma or appearance, is essential for fair assessment in competitions. Beers with Brettanomyces may be subcategorized under this category",

The winning entry will also be entered into the GABF. \r\n\r\nThanks to the help of our five distributors, we are able to get our brews to a variety of locations(including grocery stores, beverage shops, pubs and restaurants) throughout Texas and a few other states including Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and South Carolina.

The start-up of production was dedicated to the 1980 Olympic Games.\r\n\r\nCzech experts were engaged in the project as world-renowned brewmasters. They were the ones who identified the construction site for the new brewery. The choice of construction site was determined by the main factor, namely the availability of huge reserves of soft, crystal-clear water. Today, the water from Jurassic bedrock (290 m) ensures the high quality of our products.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, the enterprise gave the impetus to developing the largest corporation in Ukraine to produce beer, low alcohol and soft drinks, and mineral water.\r\n\r\nThe plant received its current name only in 1986, after the district of Kyiv with the same name. The word ‘Obolon’ comes from the times of Kievan Rus, when it denoted low riverside meadows.\r\n\r\nBuilt according to a Czech design, the brewery produced beer that gained wide popularity. After Ukraine became independent, Obolon was the first corporation to export hopped beverages to Europe and the USA. Obolon trademark beer started being perceived as traditional Ukrainian beer in the whole world.\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of a century, Obolon has evolved into a world-renowned trademark. Today people on five continents associate Obolon with Ukrainian beer #1.",
